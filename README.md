# Go Functional Programming

This repository is a collection of functional programming (FP) principles and patterns implemented from scratch in Go. While it may not follow the best practices for FP in Go, the focus is on demonstrating key FP concepts rather than optimizing for performance or suggesting Go as the ideal language for FP. It serves as a learning resource for developers who want to explore and understand FP principles in a non-FP language like Go.

The goal is not to offer production-ready solutions, but to provide foundational FP knowledge through Go implementations, making it accessible for those who wish to learn FP in the context of a language that doesn't inherently support it.
