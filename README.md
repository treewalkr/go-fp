# Go Functional Programming

This repository is a collection of functional programming (FP) principles and patterns implemented from scratch in Go. While it may not follow the best practices for FP in Go, the focus is on demonstrating key FP concepts rather than optimizing for performance or suggesting Go as the ideal language for FP. It serves as a learning resource for developers who want to explore and understand FP principles in a non-FP language like Go.

The goal is not to offer production-ready solutions, but to provide foundational FP knowledge through Go implementations, making it accessible for those who wish to learn FP in the context of a language that doesn't inherently support it.

## Project Overview

This repository covers essential functional programming topics, including core concepts, functional data structures, patterns, error handling, and more. Each concept is implemented without relying on external FP libraries, providing pure Go implementations of foundational FP principles.

### Key Topics

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Basic Concepts**: Pure functions, immutability, first-class functions, etc.
- **Types and Type Systems**: ADTs, product types, sum types, etc.
- **Functional Data Structures**: Immutable lists, maps, trees, etc.
- **Common Functional Patterns**: Map, filter, fold, monads, etc.
- **Recursion**: Tail recursion, recursive data structures.
- **Function Composition**: Point-free style, pipeline composition.
- **Error Handling**: Maybe, Either types.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Streams, infinite data structures.
- **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Actor model, STM.
- **Functional Testing**: Property-based testing, TDD.
- **Category Theory**: Functors, monads, and laws.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and explore each folder for implementations and documentation. Each topic has its own documentation file and Go implementation(s) for easy reference.
